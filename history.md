# WMSv2 Development History (Current Conversation)

This document tracks the key development steps, decisions, and outcomes from the current development conversation.

## Session Start: Initial Issue
- **Goal:** HTTP service (GET/POST), Swagger, Chinese GUI, Internationalized README.
- **Initial Files:** `README.md`, `required.md` (detailing WMS requirements).

## Phase 1: Core Application and API Development
1.  **Technology Stack Chosen:** Python, FastAPI (backend), Tkinter (GUI), SQLite (DB).
2.  **Project Structure Created:** `app`, `gui`, `tests`, `locale` directories, `requirements.txt`.
3.  **Core WMS Logic Implemented (Code Generation):** `app/database.py`, `app/models.py`, `app/schemas.py`, `app/crud.py` (initial version).
4.  **HTTP API Developed (Code Generation):** `app/main.py` (initial version).
5.  **Swagger UI Integration:** Automatic via FastAPI.

## Phase 2: GUI Development and Internationalization
1.  **GUI Application Developed (Code Generation):** `gui/main_window.py` (initial version).
2.  **GUI Internationalization Implemented (Code Generation):** `locale/en/LC_MESSAGES/gui.json`, `locale/zh/LC_MESSAGES/gui.json`. GUI logic for i18n.
3.  **README Internationalization:** `README.md` updated with English/Chinese sections.

## Phase 3: Critical Tooling Limitations Encountered
- **Persistent Issue:** `run_in_bash_session` tool failures for `pip install` and Python script execution involving I/O.
- **Impact:** No testing, runtime verification, or automated DB initialization possible. Code generated "blind."
- **Outcome:** User informed of manual setup necessity.

## Phase 4: Initial Submissions
1.  **First Submission (Application Code):** Branch `wms-feature-complete-untested`. Committed initial application code.

## Phase 5: Post-Submission Feedback and Design Documentation
1.  **User Feedback & Design Refinement:** Discussed ID clarification, finding empty slots, `slot_index` requirement. Proposed two-table design (`trays`, `material_locations`).
2.  **`design.md` Creation:** Documented the two-table design.
3.  **Second Submission (Design Document):** Branch `add-design-document`. Committed `design.md`.

## Phase 6: Windows Service & Backend Refactoring (Continued in Same Session)
1.  **User Request:** Continue development for Windows service and log history.
2.  **`history.md` Creation:** This file was created.
3.  **Windows Service Design:** Decided to use `pywin32` for a Python-based Windows service. Uvicorn to be managed as a subprocess by the service.
4.  **Service Helper Script (`app/service.py`):** Implemented Windows service logic using `win32serviceutil`. Added `pypiwin32` to `requirements.txt`.
5.  **Backend Refactoring (as per `design.md`):**
    *   **Models (`app/models.py`):** Created `Tray` model, modified `MaterialLocation` (added `slot_index`, FK to `Tray`, unique constraint on `tray_id, slot_index`).
    *   **Schemas (`app/schemas.py`):** Created `Tray` schemas, updated `MaterialLocation` schemas for `slot_index`. Added helper schemas (`PlaceItemRequest`, `TraySlotInit`).
    *   **CRUD (`app/crud.py`):** Added `Tray` CRUD. Modified `MaterialLocation` CRUD for `slot_index`, tray relations. Implemented logic for slot initialization, finding available slots, placing items.
    *   **API Endpoints (`app/main.py`):** Added `Tray` management endpoints. Refactored `MaterialLocation` endpoints to be tray-centric (e.g., `/trays/{tray_id}/locations/{slot_index}/...`).
6.  **GUI Finalization (`gui/main_window.py`):**
    *   Updated service control to use `sc.exe` commands.
    *   Modified CRUD operation methods to align with new tray-centric API endpoints and `slot_index`.
    *   Adjusted UI layout for `tray_id` and `slot_index` inputs.
7.  **Documentation Update:**
    *   Updated `README.md` with new API structure, Windows Service info, and references.
    *   Created `SERVICE_SETUP.md` for detailed Windows service instructions.

## Current Status:
- All coding and documentation for the requested features (WMS with tray/slot logic, Windows service integration, GUI updates) are complete from a code generation perspective.
- The critical limitation of being unable to test or run the application within the development environment persists. Manual setup and execution in a suitable Python/Windows environment by the user is required.
- Ready for final submission of all changes.
